The following files correspond to the ggplot2 tutorial exercise:
  Titanic.R
  Titanic.html
  titanic_csv
In the exercise we copied and pasted the last exercese from the ggplot2 (Part 1) tutorial.
Notes: the script as it was would not run for the following reasons:
  1) The dataset was missing from the workspace
  2) The names of the columns were different (with capital letter at the beginning)
Thus I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle website to my computer, and then I loaded in on the script.
Then I edited the script, to reference the columns correctly.
